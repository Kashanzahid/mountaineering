Positioned on the Pakistan-China border, it marks the highest point in the Karakoram range and holds the distinction of being the tallest mountain in both Pakistan and China.</p>
            <p>K2 got the nickname ‘The Savage Mountain’ because it’s tough to climb, even for experienced mountain climbers.

About 300 people have successfully climbed K2, but it’s also risky, with around 80 climbers losing their lives. No one has managed to climb K2 in winter successfully.</p>
