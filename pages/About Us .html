            <h2 style="color: dodgerblue;">Our Founder</h2>
            <div class="Col-md-8">
            <p>Dennis Broadwell grew up on the south shore of Long Island far from any mountain top. As a teenager he discovered skiing in the Catskill Mountains and hiked his first peaks in the Adirondacks of New York. He quickly became an ADK 46er, ticking off the last of the 46 tallest peaks in the Adirondacks by his early twenties. He began guiding his friends up the peaks of New England, including Mount Washington in New Hampshire’s White Mountains, where he made numerous winter ascents. After graduating from college, he traveled extensively across America and overseas while continuing to pursue rock, ice and mountain climbing. Dennis conceived of the vision for Mountain Gurus in 1997, but it wasn’t until 2008 that he incorporated the company through the encouragement of his dear friend Kili Sherpa. Dennis’ passion for mountains and exploration has led him to climb and travel all over the world. He firmly believes:<br>

                    <img id="img2" width="100%" class="" src="/images/img2.webp" alt="">
                 </div>
            <p class="paragraphquote text-primary">“Challenging yourself while exploring your world is truly one of life’s greatest experiences”</p>
               
               
             During his decades of climbing and adventure travel, Dennis has seen time and time again that when we pursue our dreams through human-powered achievement in a community of fellow adventurers, we open ourselves to a world of rich experiences and an incredibly rewarding way to live. Or as George Mallory put it:<br>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraphquote text-primary">“If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of <br> life itself upward and forever upward, then you won’t see why we go. What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy. And joy is, after all, the end of life. We do not <br> live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to live. That is what life means and what life is for.”</p>
               
            Today, Mountain Gurus follows a philosophy rooted in guiding, instruction and training. Our guides and guests pursue shared goals together – pushing ourselves to defy gravity while climbing, trekking, skiing, developing relationships across cultures, and immersing ourselves in the natural world. We firmly believe in the transformative power of international journeys. After all, as Mark Twain wrote:
            <br>
            <br>
               
            <p id="italic" class="paragraphquote1 text-primary">“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.”</p>

<div class="para Col-md-12 mt-5">
 <h2 style="color: dodgerblue;">It's a yak!</h2>
 <p >Is that a mountain goat, a buffalo, or a bison on the Mountain Gurus logo? If you are like us, you probably grew up in North America and have never encountered a yak.<br>
    <br>

    The yak is a long-haired animal (Bovinae) found throughout the high mountains of the Himalayan region. Unlike a mountain goat, which is also an excellent climber that resides below 12,000 feet, the Yak's physiology is well adapted to much higher altitudes and lives only above 9,000 feet. Their larger lungs, weight bearing capacity, and perseverance in cold, harsh, and high elevations make the yak the ultimate mountain guru. The local people of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau depend on the yak for its abundant resources, plowing fields, hauling, dung for heating & fertilizer, milk, cheese, yogurt, natural fiber for clothing, bone, and even yak riding.<br>
    <br>
    
    On many of our longer mountaineering expeditions, you will find yaks hard at work transporting food and heavy climbing gear to our base camps and to altitudes above 18,000 feet. The clang of yak bells can be heard throughout the high mountain trails of Nepal, Bhutan, India, Mongolia, and Tibet, serving as a constant reminder of what a truly special and enchanted habitat they live.

    <h2 style="color: dodgerblue;">What our clients are saying about us!</h2>
    <p id="italic" class="text-primary">“Mountain Gurus was the only option for my wife and I after speaking to many other guide services regarding our trek to and overnight stay at Everest Base Camp (EBC). The opportunity to take an adventure of a lifetime combined with the need to have the best possible support to make that dream a reality was found with the MG team. Careful planning of hiking & acclimatization days, teaming with the best Sherpa for our needs (Naga) & porter (Pasang) possible and emphasis on ensuring our food, water, lodging and overall experience was of the highest quality got us successfully & happily to EBC and back again. Dennis and his experienced team gave us the opportunity to fully experience both Nepal and celebrate our wedding anniversary at EBC, complete with a baked chocolate cake…that was over the top and a clear indication of just how good MG is at taking care of their clients.” Greg Y April 2015″<br>
        <br>

        “Mountain Gurus, thank you for your assistance in planning our trip, we had a fantastic time. The team supporting us were fabulous, the guides looked after us incredibly well and we enjoyed getting to know them. As we climbed, we came to appreciate how important their advice was to our prospects of reaching the summit (pole pole!), yet they still made the journey to the top enjoyable and primaryrmative. Coming into the camp each day to a song from the porters was an unforgettable experience, and we are grateful for how comfortable they made the trip for us. Camping 200 vertical meters higher than other groups on the night before we summited meant reaching the top was much easier, that special permit is gold! We always felt like we were in the hands of the best and this helped to make the experience truly unforgettable.” Rick K June 2014“<br>
        <br>
        
        “I joined Northwest Alpine Guides for an Intro to Mountaineering course this summer and don't think I could've discovered, experienced, and learned any more than I did during such a valuable four day trip. I was really impressed with the pre-planned itinerary that packed in a range of mountaineering, alpine, rock, and general outdoor safety and wilderness skills - Once the program started and we got on our feet we got to discuss and learn even more. The preparedness, efficiency, knowledge and humor of the guides made the trip all the more entertaining. We really enjoyed our down time and great meals at camp, just as much as reaching the summit of Mt. Shuksan. I ended up liking the program so much that I joined them for a subsequent climb of Mt. Baker, and Mt. Rainier a week later. The mountains in the PNW are truly majestic and unlike anything else. Overall I came to NWAG looking to further my mountaineering education, and I came away with a great new skill set and huge appreciation for such a well-rounded program… Trust these guys, they know what they're doing!
