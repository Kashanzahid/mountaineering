            <h4 class="text-uppercase mb-4 font-weight-bold text-primary">1. Mount Everest</h4>
            <p>Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world that inspires awe and respect from adventurers worldwide. At 29,032 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level, this beautiful giant is located in the breathtaking Himalayan range. Everest was first climbed in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and it still draws daring people who want to challenge themselves in the face of great elevations and unpredictability in the weather.</p>
            <p>Scaling Everest needs precise planning and unshakable determination. Usually, the trip starts in Tibet in the north or Nepal in the south, with each offering its own set of difficulties. This daring climb involves traversing the dangerous Khumbu Icefall, climbing the perilous Lhotse Face, and reaching the summit.</p>
            <p>Besides its breathtaking height, Everest’s slopes are carved with a shared history of tragedy and triumph. Everest climbing continues to be a representation of human tenacity, with each step taken serving as evidence of the spirit of unwavering exploration. Everest stands proudly as a testament to human perseverance in the face of immense adversity and the magnificence of nature. </p>

        <div class="text-md-left">
            <h4 class="text-uppercase mb-4 font-weight-bold text-primary">2. K2 ( Mount Godwin-Austen )</h4>
            <p>K2 in Pakistan is like a precious gem because of its stunning beauty and cultural importance. K2 is called “K2” because it is the second peak in the Karakoram Range, with “K” representing Karakoram and the 2nd <a href="" style="text-decoration: none;" class="text-primary">highest mountain on earth.</a> K2 is also recognized as Mount Godwin-Austen or Chhogori. At 28,251 feet (8,611 meters) above sea level. Positioned on the Pakistan-China border, it marks the highest point in the Karakoram range and holds the distinction of being the tallest mountain in both Pakistan and China.</p>
            <p>K2 got the nickname ‘The Savage Mountain’ because it’s tough to climb, even for experienced mountain climbers. Climbing from the Chinese side is even harder, so most climbers try to climb it from the Pakistan side. About 300 people have successfully climbed K2, but it’s also risky, with around 80 climbers losing their lives. No one has managed to climb K2 in winter successfully.</p>
            <img class="imghover" style="border-radius: 15px;" src="/images/kk2.jpg" width="100%" alt="">
            <p></p>
            For people who want to visit, K2 is a stunning place with tall mountains that attract adventurers. As the second-highest mountain globally, it’s a great spot for those looking for a challenging climb and beautiful views. K2 is also culturally important, known as “Chhogori” locally, making it a fascinating destination for both adventure seekers and those interested in the local heritage.

            <h4 class="text-uppercase mb-4 font-weight-bold text-primary">3. Kangchenjunga</h4>
            <p>The third-highest peak in the world is Kangchenjunga which guards the eastern Himalayas, dividing India and Nepal. With five separate summits, Kangchenjunga’s name translates to “The Five Treasures of Snow,” reflecting its tremendous height of 28,169 feet (8,586 meters) above sea level.</p>
            <img class="imghover" style="border-radius: 15px;" src="/images/Kangchenjunga.jpg" width="100%" alt="">
            <p></p>
            <p>The journey to summit Kangchenjunga is a hard test of stamina and mountaineering bravery. Because of its remote location, difficult weather, and complicated terrain, the ascent is a difficult task. Since its initial ascent in 1955 by a British expedition under the leadership of Charles Evans, the peaks of Kangchenjunga have enticed explorers with the promise of unmatched views and the excitement of reaching one of the highest summits on Earth.</p>
            <p>ecosystems found there, from alpine meadows to subtropical woods.

            <p>As the fourth-highest mountain on Earth, Lhotse is a threatening neighbor of Mount Everest in the Himalayan range. At 27,940 feet (8,516 meters) above sea level, Lhotse is a spectacular peak with difficult climbing due to its snowy faces and treacherous landscape.</p>
            <p>The journey to climb Lhotse is inherently connected with Everest, as climbers often face both peaks in a single expedition. Along with Everest, the South Col route puts climbers to the test as it passes via the infamous Lhotse Face and the Khumbu Icefall, putting their endurance to the test in harsh circumstances. Climbers are rewarded with enchanting views of the neighboring Himalayan peaks from the top of Lhotse, which is distinguished by a spectacular pyramid clad in ice.</p>
            <p>Ever since the Swiss expedition led by Fritz Luchsinger and Ernst Reiss successfully ascended Mount Everest in 1956, Lhotse has gained worldwide recognition as the ultimate destination for climbing enthusiasts. It requires technical expertise and unrelenting commitment due to its steep, slippery slopes and unpredictable weather.</p>

            <p>The ascent of Makalu takes place in the middle of harsh weather and stunning scenery. The mountain’s high ridges, ice and rock formations, and the infamous Kangshung Face offer a formidable task for climbers. Makalu’s ascent, which began in 1955 with a French team under the direction of Jean Franco, is a story of human tenacity triumphing over the raw forces of nature.</p>
            <img class="imghover" style="border-radius: 15px;" src="/images/Makalu.avif" width="100%" alt="">
